This parser was developed as a supplementary tool for my main project — a website that generates practice tasks for the Unified State Exam (EGE) in mathematics.

The program automatically extracts task conditions as images and their corresponding answers from prof.mathege.ru, enabling quick population of the task database for the generator.
